# Test Human Player Data Fix

## What was wrong:
1. SetupScreen was calling `onGameStart(firstHandState)` - passing a game state object
2. PokerApp expected `onGameStart(playerSetup)` - expecting a player setup object  
3. This caused a double initialization and playerSetup validation failure

## What was fixed:
1. SetupScreen now only validates and passes `playerSetup` to parent
2. PokerApp handles all game initialization via useGameFlow
3. Clear separation of concerns between setup validation and game initialization

## Test Instructions:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Open Chrome DevTools console
3. Enter your name (e.g., "TestUser")
4. Click "Start Tournament"

## Expected Console Output:
```
SetupScreen validation passed, using playerSetup: {humanPlayer: {name: "TestUser"}, aiPlayers: [...]}
