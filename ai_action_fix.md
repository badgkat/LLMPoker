# AI Action Validation Fix

## 🔍 **Problem Identified:**
```
AI_DECISION_ERROR for AI Player 1: Error: Invalid action: check
```

## 🛠️ **Root Cause:**
The mock LLM service was returning random actions without considering game context:

```javascript
// BEFORE (Broken):
const mockDecisions = [
  { action: 'fold', amount: 0, reasoning: 'Mock: Weak hand, folding' },
  { action: 'call', amount: 0, reasoning: 'Mock: Calling to see more cards' },
  { action: 'check', amount: 0, reasoning: 'Mock: Checking for free card' },  // ❌ Always available
  { action: 'raise', amount: 400, reasoning: 'Mock: Strong hand, raising for value' }
];
```

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**
The mock LLM now intelligently parses available actions from the prompt:

```javascript
// AFTER (Fixed):
// Extract available actions from the prompt
const availableActionsMatch = prompt.match(/Available actions: (.+)/);
let availableActions = ['fold', 'call']; // default fallback

if (availableActionsMatch) {
  availableActions = availableActionsMatch[1].split(', ').map(action => action.trim());
}

// Only add decisions that are actually available
if (availableActions.includes('check')) {
  mockDecisions.push({ action: 'check', amount: 0, reasoning: 'Mock: Checking for free card' });
}
```

## 🎯 **Game Context:**
- **Preflop**: Big blind = 200, so current bet = 200
- **UTG Player**: currentBet = 0, so callAmount = 200 - 0 = 200
- **Available Actions**: `["call", "fold", "raise", "all-in"]` (NOT "check")
- **Why No Check**: Can only check when callAmount = 0 (no bet to call)

## 📊 **Expected Logs:**
```
LLM Service making decision with provider: mock
Mock LLM detected available actions: ["call", "fold", "raise", "all-in"]
Mock LLM decision: {action: "call", amount: 0, reasoning: "Mock: Calling to see more cards"}
AI AI Player 1 decision: {action: "call", amount: 0, reasoning: "Mock: Calling to see more cards"}
✅ Action validation passed!
```

## 🧪 **Test Instructions:**
1. Refresh the page at http://localhost:3000
2. Start a new game
3. Watch console - should see detailed AI decision logging
4. Game should proceed without AI action errors
5. AI players should make valid moves

## 💡 **Key Improvement:**
The mock LLM is now context-aware and will only suggest actions that are actually legal in the current game situation, preventing validation errors and game crashes.
