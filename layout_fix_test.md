# Action Panel Layout Fix

## Problem Fixed:
The bottom of the action panel was getting cut off, making it impossible to see all the action buttons.

## Root Cause:
1. **Fixed Height Container**: Footer had `h-64` (256px) fixed height
2. **Overflow Content**: ActionPanel content was taller than available space
3. **Poor Flex Layout**: Content wasn't properly constrained

## Changes Applied:

### 1. PokerTable Footer (`PokerTable.jsx:224`):
```javascript
// BEFORE: Fixed height causing overflow
<div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto flex gap-4 h-64">

// AFTER: Dynamic height with minimum
<div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto flex gap-4" style={{ minHeight: '280px', height: 'auto' }}>
```

### 2. ActionPanel Container (`ActionPanel.jsx:185`):
```javascript
// BEFORE: Could overflow without constraint
<div className="h-full flex flex-col">

// AFTER: Constrained with overflow handling
<div className="h-full flex flex-col overflow-hidden" style={{ minHeight: '250px', maxHeight: '260px' }}>
```

### 3. Spacing Optimizations:
- **Header**: Reduced from `text-lg` to `text-base`
- **Margins**: Reduced from `mb-3` to `mb-2` throughout
- **Button Padding**: Reduced from `py-2.5` to `py-2`
- **GameLog Height**: Increased from 240px to 260px

## Expected Result:
- ✅ All action buttons fully visible
- ✅ No content cutoff at bottom
- ✅ Proper spacing between elements
- ✅ Responsive layout that adapts to content
- ✅ GameLog and ActionPanel heights match

## Test Instructions:
1. Refresh the page at http://localhost:3000
2. Start a new game
3. Check that all action buttons (CALL, FOLD, etc.) are fully visible
4. Verify no content is cut off at the bottom
5. Test on different screen sizes

## Layout Hierarchy:
```
Footer (min-height: 280px, auto-height)
├── GameLog (max-height: 260px)
└── ActionPanel (min-height: 250px, max-height: 260px)
    ├── Header (compact)
    ├── Raise Controls (if available)
    ├── Game Info (compact)
    └── Action Buttons (bottom-aligned)
```
