# All-In Situation Fix

## üîç **Problem Identified:**
When all non-folding players went all-in before the flop:
1. Game would advance to flop
2. Deal flop cards
3. Try to advance again (no one can act)
4. Deal the same flop again (bug!)
5. Game freezes in infinite loop

## üõ†Ô∏è **Root Cause:**
The `advanceToNextPhase()` function only advanced one betting round at a time. When everyone is all-in, there's no more betting, so the game should skip ALL remaining rounds and go directly to showdown.

## ‚úÖ **Fix Applied:**

### 1. New Function: `handleAllInSituation()` (`gameEngine.js:540`)
```javascript
handleAllInSituation(gameState) {
  // Deals ALL remaining community cards at once based on current round:
  // - Preflop: Deal flop (3) + turn (1) + river (1) = 5 cards + 3 burns
  // - Flop: Deal turn (1) + river (1) = 2 cards + 2 burns  
  // - Turn: Deal river (1) = 1 card + 1 burn
  // - River: Go directly to showdown
  
  // Then goes directly to showdown
  return this.showdown(updatedState);
}
```

### 2. Updated Game Flow Logic (`usePlayerActions.js:154`)
```javascript
// BEFORE: Advanced one round at a time (causing loops)
if (playersWhoCanAct.length === 0) {
  const nextPhaseState = gameEngine.advanceToNextPhase(newGameState);
  setGameState(nextPhaseState);
}

// AFTER: Handle all-in situation properly
if (playersWhoCanAct.length === 0) {
  console.log('All remaining players are all-in - handling all-in situation');
  addLogEntry("All remaining players are all-in - dealing remaining cards and going to showdown");
  const showdownState = gameEngine.handleAllInSituation(newGameState);
  setGameState(showdownState);
}
```

## üéØ **Expected Behavior:**

### All-In Preflop Scenario:
1. Players go all-in during preflop betting
2. Game detects no more players can act
3. **Single operation**: Deal flop (3) + turn (1) + river (1) cards
4. Go directly to showdown
5. Determine winners and distribute chips
6. Start next hand

### Console Logs You Should See:
```
All remaining players are all-in - handling all-in situation
===== HANDLING ALL-IN SITUATION =====
Current betting round: preflop
All-in preflop: dealing flop, turn, and river
Dealt flop: [card1, card2, card3]
Dealt turn: [card4]
Dealt river: [card5]
All community cards dealt, going to showdown
Final community cards: [card1, card2, card3, card4, card5]
```

## üß™ **Test Instructions:**
1. Start a new game
2. Force an all-in situation (bet aggressively)
3. Watch console logs - should see the new all-in handling
4. Verify all 5 community cards are dealt at once
5. Game should proceed to showdown without loops
6. Next hand should start properly

## üí° **Key Improvement:**
- **No more loops**: Single transition from all-in to showdown
- **Proper card dealing**: All remaining cards dealt with proper burn cards
- **Clear logging**: Easy to debug what's happening
- **Performance**: Faster resolution of all-in hands
