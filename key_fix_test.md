# React Key Duplication Fix Test

## Problem Fixed:
The GameLog component was generating duplicate React keys, causing the warning:
```
Warning: Encountered two children with the same key, `1`. Keys should be unique...
```

## Root Cause:
1. **Current Hand Entries**: Using `key={`current-${index}`}` could create duplicates when filtering
2. **Hand History**: Using `key={hand.handNumber}` could create duplicates if handNumbers repeat  
3. **History Entries**: Using `key={`hand-${hand.handNumber}-${entryIndex}`}` could collide with current hand

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Current Hand Entries (Line 211):
**Before:** `key={`current-${index}`}`
**After:** `key={`current-${gameState.handNumber}-${index}-${entry.timestamp || index}`}`

### 2. Hand History Items (Line 231):
**Before:** `key={hand.handNumber}`
**After:** `key={`hand-history-${hand.handNumber}-${index}`}`

### 3. History Entry Items (Line 252):
**Before:** `key={`hand-${hand.handNumber}-${entryIndex}`}`
**After:** `key={`history-${hand.handNumber}-${entryIndex}-${entry.timestamp || entryIndex}`}`

## Test Instructions:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Open Chrome DevTools Console
3. Enter your name and start a game
4. Play a few hands to generate log entries
5. Check the console - the React key warning should be gone

## Key Strategy:
- Include **handNumber** to separate between different hands
- Include **prefix** (current/history) to separate between current and historical entries  
- Include **timestamp** when available for additional uniqueness
- Fallback to **index** if timestamp is missing
- Use **array index** as additional separator for hand history

## Expected Result:
- No more React key duplication warnings
- GameLog continues to function normally
- Performance remains stable (no unnecessary re-renders)
